\section{Conclusion}
From medicine to applied mathematics, to analytics, and then to logic, 
Curry adjusted his research direction three times in his life. 
As an double-major student, I'm deeply inspired by Curry's perseverance and decisiveness. 
I now major in theoretical computer science and mathematics (especially logic), 
and hope that I could make a difference in these fields, like Dr.~Curry did.

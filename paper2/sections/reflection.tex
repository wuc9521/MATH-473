\section{Reflection}

Everyone contributed a lot to the group task and was actively involved in discussing and completing the presentation and the paper, not only that, in order to work more efficiently and perfectly, we took out two weekends at the end of April and the beginning of May to meet and communicate offline to finalize our slides presentation and final paper. It's hard to ditinguish each group memberâ€™s role, but we all put all efforts on this.

\Huge\textbf{MATH 473 Mid-term Paper-I}
$$

### Purpose

The goal of this paper is to give a mathematician's biography describing their life, the wider historical context surrounding them, and their major mathematical breakthroughs. You want to give a fairly good essence of the mathematician's life and their major contributions. Choose a more obscure mathematician (e.g. not Euler, Gauss, or Newton) in order to complete the biography in a relatively short amount of text. You can find a mathematician at the University of St. Andrews [Mathematician BiographiesLinks to an external site.](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/). Please list the mathematician you choose in [Biography Paper Mathematicians](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/386563/discussion_topics/1761502) discussion. Please do not select a mathematician that someone else has already chosen.

 

### Audience

Your audience are your peers, i.e. typical mathematics majors who may or may not have taken this course. They are familiar with various proof methods, calculus, and some basic mathematical definitions (e.g. sets, modulo arithmetic, or vector spaces); however, they may not necessarily know technical concepts like compactness, fundamental groups, boolean algebras, or stabilizers from particular upper-level mathematics courses.

 

### Objectives

While your biography will contain relevant information about the mathematician's life and their historical context, it should contain some detail in their mathematical achievements. You should have some mathematics included in your paper. Roughly about one-third to half of your paper should explain the person's mathematical work. It can be a broader description of their work. Below are some important features your paper should include.

* Biographical information *Who was this person? Where did they live and work?*
* Historical context *Who influenced them? How did they fit into a broader historical context? Were their peers in which they corresponded with?*
* Mathematical achievements *What did they discover? How did their discovery influence mathematics, science, or other fields?*

 

### References

You may start your investigation with the University of St. Andrews [Mathematician BiographiesLinks to an external site.](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/). However, you should draw your information from primary and secondary sources (the references on this website are typically primary and secondary sources). Especially notice differences between the sources. In your paper, select and summarize what you have discovered about the person's life and mathematical works. The citation of tertiary sources is not allowed. List your references in a bibliography. There should be a minimum of four diverse sources.

 

### Format

Your paper should be approximately 1000 words in length (1500 word length maximum). It should typed (including mathematical formulas), double-spaced (excluding the mathematical formulas), and 12-pt font in an appropriate font style (e.g. Times Roman). You should meet these other requirements as well:

* * * Title your paper appropriately.
    * Write using proper grammar, spelling, and complete sentences. Organize your paper and paragraphs around main ideas.
    * Accurately state facts in your paper. Use references where appropriate.
    * Write in your own words. Properly cite any statement or idea that are not your own (whether verbatim or paraphrased).
    * Label any pictures, figures, or diagrams. Include captions describing figures.
    * Use standard bibliographic style and citation.
    * Submit your document as .pdf, .doc, or docx file.

\section{Introduction}

Haskell Brooks Curry\cite{enwiki:1192145129} (1900-1982) was an American mathematician and logician who made significant contributions to the field of mathematical logic and the theory of computation. He is best known for his work on combinatory logic, which is a formal system for expressing computation independent of the order of evaluation. Curry's work on combinatory logic laid the foundation for the development of functional programming languages, which are a class of programming languages that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoid changing-state and mutable data. The most famous functional programming language, Haskell, is named after him. In this paper, we will explore the life and work of Haskell Curry, and discuss his legacy in the field of computer science.

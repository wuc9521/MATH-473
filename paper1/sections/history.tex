\section{History of Logic and Computation}
Since Curry is a prestigious Mathematical Logician, it is important to understand the history of logic and computation. The history of logic and computation is a long and complex one. It is a history that has been shaped by the work of many great minds.

In the mid-19th century, the concept of mathematical logic began to emerge.

In the early 20th century, logicians and mathematicians started exploring the relationship between logic and computation.

In the 1930s, Gödel, Turing, Skolem, and others proposed famous concepts such as Gödel's incompleteness theorem, Turing machines, Skolem functions, and so forth.

In this context, Church's Lambda calculus and Turing's Turing machine became two important theoretical foundations for logic and computation. Their work laid the groundwork for the development of computer science.

Haskell's work further developed upon this foundation. His combinatory logic laid the groundwork for the development of functional programming languages. His contributions hold significant importance for the advancement of computer science.
